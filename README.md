Repository for the code used in my AIT664 class to analyze system and network information and provide anomaly detection through machine learning

**`Implementing Data Driven Analysis and Machine Learning on Cyber Attacks`**

This is code used for a M.S. course project in which we will be utilizing data analysis and machine learning to detect malicious network traffic. 
Questions to be answered:
- How can machine learning techniques be effectively employed to detect anomalies in network traffic data and identify potential cyber-attacks?
- Does Random Forest classifier accurately predict the category of cyber-attacks based on network traffic data, and certain features play a significant role in making these predictions.
- Using Deep learning models, such as convolutional or recurrent neural networks, does it have the potential to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection in network traffic.

Datasets used:
